## for better responsive designs in CSS 
### @media (min-width : 600px) { p { font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1rem; } } - Through this while zooming in or out, or maybe opening the web browser on smaller and bigger screen. it will automatically adjust the font size, line height and is easy to readable. It is for mobile width as the screen size gets bigger. we can use max width if the desktop screen size gets smaller. 

### @media (orientation: landscape) {} / @media (orientation: portrait) as per mobile screen size and functionality you want.
