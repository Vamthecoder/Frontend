### Learned more about Grid functionallity and their properties and values.. and how grid work and where we can use grid perfectly. 
### Grid Areas will only work in same no. of columns in all rows. 
### grid area you can apply in child individually. 
### grid better work in media query with repeat(auto-fit, value) but there should be value given to each columns as you can not give each column their width to make responsive without media query. 
### jusify and align content, justify and align items will be used in only container of parent selector. 
### justify and align self will only go in child or content selector. 
### place items and content is short hand property for justify and align. 
### span 2 can work in any condition but without giving the appropriate will move the span-ed content to any location. not specific. 
### grid is a good sport when you want to work on complex designs. but for only two columns you can use flex better. 

## DOM 
### Document- File(Html,Xml), Object- tags/elements of the file, Model- Layout/Structure. which can be manipulated by JS

## HTML CSS JS Apna College
### semantic are like meaningful elements like section aside main body footer header and non semantic elements are like div span 
### adjacent are sibling element descendent are child and ascendent are parents
### in video tag you can use controls, autoplay, loop, autopictureinpicture, muted, poster and preload.
### text-align-last will only select last line of the content. can give values of center left right.
### text-decoration is shorthand property for line-style-color.
### text-emphasis is shorthand property for position-style-color and it could be great experiment to do. 
### text-indent could be one positive value for first line to move it forward and backward from its position.
### text-orientation: upright; work with writing-mode: vertical-rl; 
### text-overflow could be one good source to mention all the text if you have less space in the box.
### text-shadow is shorthand property for x-axis, y-axis, blur-radius and color. 
### text-transform could come in handy while putting text in UPPERCASE, lowercase and All First Letter Capital.
### list-style is shorthand property for type, position and image. 
### border-block can come in handy when you want to style only block of border.
### border-collapse: collapse could merge all siblings element borders all together while seprate can create two different borders of siblings.
### border-radius is shorthand property where you can use top left / top right/ right bottom / bottom left viceverse start end/ end start.
### border-image can be used to select an image to style your borders. or by help of linear-gradient you can create an image.
### border-image has different property aligned with outset, repeat, slice, source, width. 
### border-style can be covered with various values like double dotted dashed solid.
### border-spacing could come in handy while creating table and other siblings without using padding.
### order: 'number', by using this in items with the help of flex it can be used to maintain order. like grid-areas.
### flex-basis: 'max-value'. by this property in css you can use much responsiveness by flex. 
### flex-grow: '2'; will grow the item relatively to the siblings. it is more like fraction 'fr'.
### flex-shrink: '2'; will shrink the item relatively to the siblings. opposite of flex-grow.

## Basic freeCodeCamp JS
### In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
### In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
### let myVar = 1; myVar += 5; console.log(myVar); by using this '+=' you can replace myVar = myVar + 5; this command. 
### Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string. \'	single quote, \"	double quote, \\	backslash, \n	newline, \t	tab, \r	carriage return, \b	word boundary, \f	form feed

## Basic freeCodeCamp JS
### We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines. Ex. let ourStr = "I come first. "; ourStr += "I come second.";
### Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building. Ex. const ourName = "freeCodeCamp"; const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
### In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
### You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below: const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]; This is also called a multi-dimensional array.
### An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.  / .push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
### const arr = [  [1, 2, 3],  [4, 5, 6],  [7, 8, 9],  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]]; const subarray = arr[3]; const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0]; const element = arr[3][0][1];
### .pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
### pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first? That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.
### Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.  / .unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];  ourArray.shift();  ourArray.unshift("Happy");
