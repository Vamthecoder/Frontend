### Learned more about Grid functionallity and their properties and values.. and how grid work and where we can use grid perfectly. 
### Grid Areas will only work in same no. of columns in all rows.

### grid better work in media query with repeat(auto-fit, value) but there should be value given to each columns as you can not give each column their width to make responsive without media query. 
### jusify and align content, justify and align items will be used in only container of parent selector. 
### justify and align self will only go in child or content selector. 
### place items and content is short hand property for justify and align. 
### span 2 can work in any condition but without giving the appropriate will move the span-ed content to any location. not specific. 
### grid is a good sport when you want to work on complex designs. but for only two columns you can use flex better.
