# HTML Notes

## Day1

### alt attribute to show case the value when image is broken, or for reference that this specific thing is about something. 
### href - to use  some different pages or pages outside the html. 
### target attribute in image or anchor tags with the help of _blank {target="_blank"} would open link in new tab
### figure and figcaption tags just to declare there are images and their captions in that section. 
### The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
### There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
### label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.
### Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.
### The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
